# ArduinoProtractor

Arduino project for MPU6050 and Adafruit SSD1306 OLED protractor

Because I got a knock-off screen I had to edit Adafruit_SSD1306.h library and change the I2C address in setup() section.

If you're using genuine screen just install the screen library in arduino IDE and change the address in arduino sketch accordingly to screen you're using.

Sorry for polish comments in code, but it's a pretty simple piece of code.
Maybe I'll update it later.
